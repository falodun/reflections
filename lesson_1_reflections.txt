How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Viewing the diff between two versions helped me spot the bug quickly and
    easily by showing me the changes I made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can make changes without worrying about losing the current version and
    I can go back to old versions when needed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing when to create a commit allows  you to create more logical
    commits than when it's done automatically.
    But with automatic commits, you don't have remember to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files may be linked in a way that a change in one file also
    happens in the others, Git allows a change that spans through multiple
    files to be captured in one commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the history of commits while git diff shows the difference 
    between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because I know i can always return to the old version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To manage versions of my code files
